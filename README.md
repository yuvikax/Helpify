# Helpify
A Web programming project made using HTML, CSS, Angular JS, Bootstrap and PHP.

To create a user-friendly website that helps people stay connected to donation drives and 
donating surplus commodities that they have to the needy. We aim at giving a bigger, better 
platform to the NGOs not known to the masses in detail. It helps them to receive donations but 
also donate themselves to other organizations as well. It’s a mediating party website for donors 
to NGOs.
Our mission is to provide a helpful platform for any non-profit organization to register and 
display the resources they’re lacking. Which enables them to connect to donors reaching out to 
them digitally or even make payments. Searching with respect to their locality/facilities. Not 
only this, it exercises the practice of organizations helping each other out by donating goods that 
any one of them has in excess. We aim at resources being used efficiently in the right hands, for 
the right place.

Current functionality of the app includes -
1. Find your NGO!
This page will be available to the donors/users after signing up or logging in. It displays a 
table connected to the database featuring all of the organizations along with their types 
about all the resources they’re lacking and where they’re situated. Users can search 
according to their requirements and visit the NGO’s site. Or even make a payment 
through an online link.
2. NGO-NGO
This is a similar design to Find your NGO!, but for organizations themselves. It becomes 
available after registration. 
3. User Sign-up/login
Located on the same page, and validated completely. This page allows interested donors 
to sign up to our website, by filling in some details and getting added to our database. 
Once you’ve signed up, the page will allow to log you in by matching the existing details, 
if present. 
4. Contact us 
This page allows any person using the website to get in touch with our officials 
personally by submitting a query.
